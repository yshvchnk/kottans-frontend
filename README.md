Repository for homework of Kottans Front-End course

## Stage 0. Self-Study

## General

## Git Basics

- I`ve learnt two weeks of Coursera "Introduction to Git and GitHub" course and a few levels on [learngitbranching](learngitbranching.js.org). Before this course I learnt and used commom Git queries by myself (like push, pull, add, commit, init etc.). Learning mentioned materials helped me go deeper, understand how Git works and how to use more complex commands. Hope to become more familiar with this system. To be continued...
- As a practice, I`ve made a pull-request to [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/kottans/mock-repo.git).
- Learnt some of the additional materials. Markdown course I postponed for future.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

- Linux Survival (4 modules) - I\`ve already knew some of the basic commands like mkdir, cd, cp, mv, but there was a lot of new information like security mode, creating proper pathnames, work with printer. I was surprised how easy to work using simbols like ~, |, . I plan to use in future basic commands and special symbols for interaction with files and work with Git.

- HTTP 1/2 - I\`ve already knew some basic information about HTTP, but these aarticles made my thoughts a little clearer. I can\`t say that I understand everything but basic work of HTTP is quite understandable. I wasn`t surbrised by any of info here, just some info was harder to understand than another. I plan to use Google Workkit and understand all about how HTTP works by becoming more experienced.
