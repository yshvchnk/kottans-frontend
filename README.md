Repository for homework of Kottans Front-End course

## Stage 0. Self-Study

### General

- [x] Git Basics

- I`ve learnt two weeks of Coursera "Introduction to Git and GitHub" course and a few levels on [learngitbranching](learngitbranching.js.org). Before this course I learnt and used commom Git queries by myself (like push, pull, add, commit, init etc.). Learning mentioned materials helped me go deeper, understand how Git works and how to use more complex commands. Hope to become more familiar with this system. To be continued...
- As a practice, I`ve made a pull-request to [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/kottans/mock-repo.git).
- Learnt some of the additional materials. Markdown course I postponed for future.
